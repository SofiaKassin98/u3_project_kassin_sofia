For the 3-wheel omnidirectional robot:

I Base the logic of the code according to the flow diagram that I develop attached in the ***.jpeg*** file as you recommend us to do it. (go to the main folder)
I took into account the following requirements:

  'Left Arrow' key to move linearly to the left at 0.3 m/s
  'Right Arrow' key to move linearly to the right at 0.3 m/s
  'Up Arrow' key to move forward linearly at 0.3 m/s
  'Down Arrow' key to move backward linearly at 0.3 m/s
  'A' key to turn the robot left at 45 degrees/s
  'S' key to turn the robot right at 45 degrees/s
  'G' key to start Autonomous Mode for the robot
  'W' key to start Manual Mode

The robot should start in Autonomous Mode
Autonomous mode follows the next routine:

  Moves forward continuously at 0.4 m/s\
  If detects an obstacle stops and keep turning
  If obstacle is more near to the right, robot turns left
  If obstacle is more near to the left, robot turns right
  Webots world should be designed in such a way that all functionalities can be showed by just starting the simulation.

As in the previous exam i use:

DISTANCE SENSOR
For the Distance sensor i use:
Resolution: 1 
Look up table:
________________________
0    |     0     |  0  |
0.2  |  65535    |  0  |  

The range of operation is from 0 to 200 mm that is 0.2m for the min distance
(2**16)-1= 65535 for the 

SENSOR
To turn the sensor 5Â° degrees i just made this formule
180=PI
5XPI/180=0.0872    ---->The value of rotation in its specific axis

ENCODER
To calculate  the resolution of the encoder I take from the datasheet the value of 1632.67 counts per revolution                    
Resolution = 2pi/1632.67= 0.003848411073

For the values that i took from the data sheet were:

Voltage      |     no-load performance      |     stall extrapolation
             |                              |
12v          |   200 RPM, 300 mA            |  8.5 kg*cm (120 oz*in),5.6A
MOTORS

So what i did for the motors (this Pololu has an gear 34:1 with 200 RPM and a torque 120 oz-in) values:
The equivalance is 1Nm = 141.611928 oz-in 
maxTorque:  120 oz*in -----> 0.8474N*m
maxVelocity 290 RPM ------> 30.3687 rad/s
